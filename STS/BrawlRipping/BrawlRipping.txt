==== Guide to ripping effects from Brawl ====

create dir with name of effect, all exports except textures go here

brawlcrate:
  open effect model in brawlcrate
  clear all bone transforms for model
  export model as dae
  re-open file to revert changes
  export model as mdl0
  export chr0 as maya anim
  export textures as pngs to Fighter/textures/effects
  
create clr.txt file manually
  copy paste values from clr0 anim in brawlcrate
  order should be by bones, not by material
  merge in visibility anim by setting some alpha values to 0
  check the materials in brawlcrate to find constant colour value
  can leave in all of the extra frames

blender:
  open new blender window
  import dae, everything unchecked
  set armature z rot to 180
  change armature scale 0.01 -> 0.1
  edit bones, snap all to zero (cursor)
  import brawlbox anim, check import clr.txt
  delete frames after the point where nothing is visible
  set arma to rest position
  apply rot+scale to everything
  rename every mesh uv map to the same thing (dbl click bkspc enter)
  select every mesh, join with ctrl-j
  set arma to pose position
  replace images with the ones in textures/effects

manually create Render.json
  easiest way is to just copy names of textures/materials in blender
