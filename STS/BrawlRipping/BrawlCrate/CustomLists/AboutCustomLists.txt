Custom Lists Functionality Documentation

Starting in v0.9, this program has the option to write-in your own stage or fighter lists, which will be used for drop-down menus.
These lists are used when selecting options for single-player modes such as events, all-star, or classic, as well as for the editing of BrawlEx configuration files.
List generation is dependent on specific things being present in specific columns. Invalid lines will be ignored and will not be added to the lists.
If you mess up on these files, delete them and a new default version will be generated automatically the next time you start the program.
No matter the order presented in the txt file, the lists will always be sorted by the relevant Index #.

You can add comments on any line after the name has ended using "//". The comment and any spaces or tabs before it will be ignored when generating the name list.

Flags:
X: No lists will include this line, regardless of if the contents are valid or not
+s: Only lists used for single-player functionality (Classic Mode, Event matches) will include this line (if its contents are valid)
-s: Lists used for single-player functionality will ignore this line
